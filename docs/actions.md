# Home Assistant actions

TECHO5 exposes a handful of [ESPHome actions](https://esphome.io/components/api.html#actions) once
a device connects. In Home Assistant they show up under the `esphome` domain, named
`esphome.<node>_<action>` — a device named `office` exposes `esphome.office_alarm_set`, and so on.
The `<node>` prefix throughout this page is whatever name you gave the device when it was added;
substitute your own. Call any of them from **Developer Tools → Actions**, a script, or an
automation.

> **Good to know**
>
> Home Assistant registers every argument of an action as required, and refuses a call that leaves
> one out — or that sends one the action doesn't have. Where you have no opinion on an argument,
> send the value that means "no opinion" (`0` for a number, an empty string for text) rather than
> omitting it. Adding an argument to an existing action therefore breaks every automation already
> calling it, which is why a new one arrives as a new action instead.

## Connect the device to Home Assistant

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_home_assistant`.

Stores the URL and a long-lived access token the device uses to call Home Assistant's REST API
directly, separately from the ESPHome connection Home Assistant uses to talk to it. This is what
lets the device fetch things on its own — a weather forecast, a camera snapshot, a media library
listing — rather than only reporting sensors and taking commands. It's normally set once, by
whatever paired the device, and isn't something you call from an automation afterwards.

> **Good to know**
>
> Several other actions depend on this being set first: `home_show_camera` and
> `home_show_camera_sound`, `home_weather`, `home_cameras`' automatic camera list (when called with
> no `cameras`), `home_slideshow`, and the Radio Browser stations in `home_radio`. They all fetch
> in the background, so the action itself succeeds either way. Without the token they show or offer
> nothing, and the camera actions open the view with `hass: no access configured` on it in place of
> the picture.
>
> The URL must be Home Assistant's local IP address. The device calls it directly rather than
> through Home Assistant's own connection to the device, it can't look up `.local` names like
> `homeassistant.local`, and an external or Nabu Casa URL does not work.

### url (Required)

*string*

Home Assistant's base URL, reachable from the device.

### token (Required)

*string*

A long-lived access token, created from your Home Assistant user profile (**Settings → your
profile → Security → Long-lived access tokens**).

```yaml
action: esphome.office_home_assistant
data:
  url: "http://192.168.1.10:8123"
  token: !secret techo5_office_token
```

## Disconnect the device from Home Assistant for good

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_leave_home_assistant`.

For a device you're giving to someone else. The device forgets the URL and token set with
`home_assistant`, replaces the encryption key Home Assistant connects with by a new random one, and
restarts. Your Home Assistant can't connect to it again, and the device no longer calls your Home
Assistant. Alarms, radio stations, Wi-Fi and its other settings stay.

Afterward, delete the device from **Settings → Devices & services → ESPHome** in your Home Assistant.
The new key isn't shown anywhere. To add the device to another Home Assistant later, open its setup
page, go to **General**, and choose **Let a Home Assistant add this device**: for 15 minutes the
device has no key, and the Home Assistant that adds it sets one. Home Assistant sends that key over
your network unencrypted, as it does for ESPHome devices, so open the window only on a network you
trust. Adding a device with nothing typed needs a recent Home Assistant (tested with 2026.9).

### confirm (Required)

*string*

Must be `leave`. Anything else changes nothing, so a stray tap in the action list is harmless.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_leave_home_assistant
data:
  confirm: leave
```

## Set an alarm

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_alarm_set`.

Sets an alarm on the device, or turns back on the one that already rings at that time, on those
days, with that label. Alarms set this way ring from the device's own clock, even while Home
Assistant is down.

### time (Required)

*string*

A time of day: `7:30`, `07:30`, `19:30:00`, `7:30 pm`, `7:30pm`, `3 pm`, or `3pm`.

### days (Optional)

*string*

Which days it repeats on. One of `once` (the default — rings once and turns itself off), `daily`
(or `every day`, `everyday`), `weekdays`, `weekends`, or a comma- or space-separated list of days,
matched by prefix: `mon,wed,fri`, `tue thu`.

### label (Optional)

*string*

Free text shown on the device's screen and in Home Assistant's next-alarm sensor. When the alarm
rings, the device also has Home Assistant say it out loud once (this needs **Allow the device to
perform Home Assistant actions**; without it the alarm just rings).

```yaml
action: esphome.office_alarm_set
data:
  time: "7:30 am"
  days: weekdays
  label: Wake up
```

## Set a silent alarm

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_alarm_set_silent`.

The same as `alarm_set`, with the same `time`, `days` and `label`, for an alarm that makes no sound
and shows no ring: it only fires the `silent` [alarm event](#alarm-events), for an automation to wake
the house its own way (the radio, the blinds, a light). Setting the same alarm again with
`alarm_set` makes it ring again.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_alarm_set_silent
data:
  time: "6:45 am"
  days: weekdays
  label: Bedroom
```

## Alarm events

Each step of an alarm fires `esphome.techo5_alarm` on Home Assistant's bus, with:

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `event` | `ringing`, `silent` (a silent alarm went off), `snoozed`, or `stopped` (by a press, by voice, from Home Assistant, or after ringing its course) |
| `id` | The alarm's id, the same for an alarm and its snoozes |
| `label` | The alarm's label |
| `due` | When it was due, like `2026-10-01T06:45:00-06:00` |
| `device` | The device's name |

A snoozed alarm fires `ringing` again when it comes back. Reminders fire nothing here. The device
needs **Allow the device to perform Home Assistant actions** turned on in its ESPHome integration
options for events to arrive.

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: event
    event_type: esphome.techo5_alarm
    event_data:
      event: silent
      label: Bedroom
actions:
  - action: script.good_morning
```

## Set a reminder

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_reminder_set`.

Sets a reminder: at its time the device chimes, says the label out loud once, and leaves it on the
screen until somebody taps it or presses **Stop alarm or timer**. It can go off on other devices in the
house as well, and stopping it on any one of them stops it on all of them. Reminders sound during
quiet hours, like alarms. A Dot has no screen, so there it is the chime and the words, and nothing is
left to dismiss afterwards. Answers with the new reminder's `id` if called with a `response_variable`.

> **Good to know**
>
> The device can't turn words into speech itself, so it asks Home Assistant to say the label, in the
> voice your assistant already uses. That needs **Allow the device to perform Home Assistant
> actions** turned on for each device (see [getting started](getting-started.md)). Without it, or
> with Home Assistant down, a reminder still chimes and shows its label; it just isn't spoken.
>
> Going off on other devices uses the same device-to-device link as announcements, so every device
> needs the same **house word** set on its setup page. A device that hasn't been updated yet shows
> the reminder as an announcement instead.

### time (Required)

*string*

A time of day, in the same formats as `alarm_set`'s `time`, or a time from now: `in 20 minutes`,
`1 hour and 30 minutes`, `1h30m`. A time from now is rounded up to the next whole minute and
happens once. It must be less than a day away: for tomorrow at the same time or later, give a time
of day instead.

### days (Optional)

*string*

Same as `alarm_set`'s `days`. Leave it out, or use `once`, for a time from now. For a one-off on a particular day, give the day instead: `today`, `tomorrow`, or a date written
`2026-09-29`. A day whose time has already gone by is refused.

### label (Required)

*string*

What to say, such as `Take the medication`. A reminder with nothing to say is refused.

### ring_on (Optional)

*string*

Other devices it goes off on too, by the names they have in TECHO5, comma-separated
(`Kitchen, Office`), or `everywhere` for every device in the house. Left blank, it goes off only on
this device. It always goes off on this device as well.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_reminder_set
data:
  time: "in 20 minutes"
  label: Take the pasta off
  ring_on: Kitchen
response_variable: set
```

## Stop a ring and set reminders by voice

Home Assistant keeps no alarms or reminders of its own, so "stop the alarm" or "remind me to..." said
to a TECHO5 device reaches Home Assistant with nothing there to act on, and it answers "OK" having
done nothing. Three automations hand those sentences back to the device that heard them. Add each one
in Settings > Automations & scenes > Create automation > Edit in YAML.

The device stops a ring by itself as well, without these: while an alarm or timer rings, the wake
word silences it, and a sentence that only asks to stop ("stop", "stop the alarm", "turn it off")
ends it. A sentence that asks to snooze ("snooze", "snooze for ten minutes", "snooze the alarm
another 5 minutes") snoozes it, for that long or for the device's snooze length, from 1 to 30
minutes; a ringing timer cannot be put off, so it stops. The automations are what make Home Assistant
answer "Stopped." or "Snoozed until 7:42 AM." rather than not understanding.

```yaml

```

All three find the device that heard the sentence, so one of each covers every TECHO5 device in the
house, and a speaker that is not a TECHO5 device is left alone. The snooze automation passes the whole
sentence to `esphome.<name>_alarm_snooze_for`, which reads the length from it the same way the device
does and answers with `snoozed`, `minutes` and `until` (or `snoozed: false`, with `stopped` if a timer
was stopped instead). Like the reminder's, its action name comes from the device's name in Home
Assistant.

The reminder automation takes the whole sentence apart itself, because speech to text is not
consistent about how it writes a time: "8.14am", "8.14 a.m." and "8-18 AM" all turn up. It takes a
time of day or a length of time ("for 3 minutes", "in 20 minutes"), days with "weekly", "every" or
"daily" ("every weekday", "weekly ... on Wednesday"), and the words to say, and it answers with what
it set. It also catches "set a reminder...", which Home Assistant would otherwise take as a timer. A
one-time reminder on a particular day ("for Tuesday at 6 PM") is not something the device can hold
yet, and it says so. The reminder's action name comes from the
device's name in Home Assistant (`esphome.<name>_reminder_set`); if you renamed the device there,
put its action name in by hand.

## Set, cancel and list alarms, and change the volume, by voice

Home Assistant's own voice commands know timers but not clock alarms, so "set an alarm for 6:30",
"cancel the alarm" and "what alarms do I have" get "Sorry, I don't know" or fall through to an AI
agent if you have one. Its volume command works, but it changes every speaker in the room's area,
so in a room with a TV or another speaker, "volume down" can turn down the wrong one. These three
automations answer those sentences on the TECHO5 device that heard them. Add each one in Settings >
Automations & scenes > Create automation > Edit in YAML.

```

Like the two above, each one finds the device that heard the sentence, so one of each covers every
TECHO5 device in the house. The volume one works for any voice satellite that has its own media
player. "Cancel the alarm" cancels
the only alarm there is, or lists them and asks which when there are several; "cancel all alarms"
cancels every one; "cancel the 6 AM alarm" cancels the ones at that time. Reminders are never
canceled by these. These sentences now belong to the automations wherever they are said, so from the
Home Assistant app, which has no alarms or speaker of its own, they answer by saying which device
to ask. The alarm actions' names come from the device's name in
Home Assistant (`esphome.<name>_alarm_set`); if you renamed the device there, put its action name in
by hand.

## Delete an alarm

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_alarm_delete`.

Deletes every device alarm at the given time. Fails if none is found.

### time (Required)

*string*

Same formats as `alarm_set`'s `time`.

### label (Optional)

*string*

Only delete alarms at that time whose label matches (case-insensitive). Left blank, every alarm at
that time is deleted regardless of label.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_alarm_delete
data:
  time: "7:30 am"
  label: Wake up
```

## Delete one alarm by its ID

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_alarm_delete_id`.

Deletes exactly one device alarm or reminder, picked by the ID `alarms_list` gives it. Use this when two alarms
share a time and you want only one of them gone. Fails if there is no alarm with that ID.

### id (Required)

*string*

An alarm's `id` from `alarms_list`.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_alarm_delete_id
data:
  id: "{{ listing.alarms[0].id }}"
```

## List alarms and timers

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_alarms_list`.

Answers with everything on the device that will or might ring: its own alarms, snoozed alarms,
the Home Assistant helpers it follows, the timers counting down, and whatever is ringing right now.
This action answers with data; call it with a `response_variable`.

Takes no parameters.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_alarms_list
response_variable: listing
```

The answer looks like this. Times are in the device's time zone; `next` is empty for an alarm that
is off or will not ring again.

```yaml
ringing: null            # or {label: "Wake up", since: "2026-09-24T06:45:00-05:00"}
alarms:
  - id: "m1x2y3"
    time: "06:45"
    days: weekdays
    label: Wake up
    "on": true
    next: "2026-09-24T06:45:00-05:00"
    reminder: false      # true for one set with reminder_set
    ring_on: []          # the other devices a reminder goes off on
snoozed: []              # each {label, at}
followed: []             # each {entity, label, armed, next}
timers:
  - id: "local:n4k2"
    label: Pasta
    left_seconds: 272
    total_seconds: 600
    running: true
    local: true          # false for a timer set by voice through Home Assistant
```

## Start a timer

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_timer_start`.

Starts a timer that belongs to the device: it counts down, shows and rings here, and keeps going
with Home Assistant down. Answers with the new timer's `id`, for `timer_cancel`, if called with a
`response_variable`; it works without one too.

### duration (Required)

*string*

How long: `10 minutes`, `1 hour and 30 minutes`, `90 seconds`, `in 20 minutes`, `1h30m`,
`00:10:00` (what Home Assistant's duration selector gives), `1:30` (hours and minutes), or a bare
number, which is minutes. At most 24 hours.

### label (Optional)

*string*

A name shown on the screen while it counts down and when it rings, such as `Pasta`.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_timer_start
data:
  duration: "10 minutes"
  label: Pasta
response_variable: started
```

## Cancel a timer

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_timer_cancel`.

Cancels one of the device's own timers, the ones started with `timer_start` or on its screen.
Timers set by voice through Home Assistant's Assist are canceled by voice, the same way they were
set, and this action refuses them with a message saying so.

To silence a timer that is already ringing, press the device's **Stop alarm or timer** button entity
instead; it stops alarms and timers alike.

### id (Required)

*string*

A timer's `id`, from `timer_start`'s answer or `alarms_list`'s `timers`, or `all` to cancel every
timer of the device's own.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_timer_cancel
data:
  id: "{{ started.id }}"
```

## Follow Home Assistant helpers as alarms

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_alarms_follow`.

Wires `input_datetime` helpers to ring as alarms on the device, alongside any set with `alarm_set`.
Each call replaces the whole followed list — to follow several helpers, list them all in one call
rather than calling this action once per helper.

### entities (Required)

*string*

A comma-separated list. Each entry is either a bare entity —

```text
input_datetime.wake
```

— which is always armed whenever the helper has a time set, or an entity paired with a second one
that arms it, written `entity=arm_entity`:

```text
input_datetime.wake=input_boolean.wake_armed
```

Here the alarm only rings while `input_boolean.wake_armed` is anything other than `off`.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_alarms_follow
data:
  entities: input_datetime.wake=input_boolean.wake_armed,input_datetime.weekend_wake
```

## Choose which cameras the device shows

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_home_cameras`.

Sets the list of cameras offered on the device's Cameras page and by voice ("show the front door").

### cameras (Optional)

*string*

A comma-separated list of `entity=Display Name` pairs:

```text
camera.front_door=Front door,camera.deck=Deck
```

The `=Display Name` half can be left off, in which case the entity ID is used with its `camera.`
prefix stripped. Left out entirely, the device instead lists every camera entity Home Assistant
has, refreshed every 10 minutes — this needs `home_assistant` to be set up first.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_home_cameras
data:
  cameras: camera.front_door=Front door,camera.deck=Deck
```

## Show a camera on screen

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_home_show_camera`.

Puts one camera's live view up on the device's screen for a while — for an automation that shows
the front door when the doorbell rings. The camera's audio follows the device's own **Camera
sound** setting; `home_show_camera_sound` is the same view with the sound decided by the caller.

A camera's sound plays over whatever the device is playing rather than instead of it: the music
carries on underneath, quieter, and comes back up when the view ends. Nothing is taken from the
room's music, so a Music Assistant group is not left.

> **Good to know**
>
> Needs `home_assistant` set up first. This action fetches the camera's snapshot from Home
> Assistant directly. Without it the action still succeeds, but the view shows
> `hass: no access configured` in place of the picture.

### entity (Required)

*string*

The camera entity to show. Does not need to be one of the cameras set with `home_cameras`.

### seconds (Required)

*integer*

How long to show it for. `0` means the default, 30 seconds.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_home_show_camera
data:
  entity: camera.front_door
  seconds: 60
```

## Show a camera with its sound decided here

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_home_show_camera_sound`.

Shows a camera exactly as `home_show_camera` does, and decides whether its audio plays while the
view is up: a doorbell automation can ask for the front door to be heard whatever the device's own
setting says, or refuse a camera in a room somebody is sleeping in, for that one view. An
automation with no opinion about sound should keep calling `home_show_camera`.

> **Good to know**
>
> Everything `home_show_camera` says applies, `home_assistant` included. The sound additionally
> needs a camera Home Assistant can stream (it plays the camera's stream to this device and
> converts it on the way, the same way it plays a radio station). A camera that cannot be streamed
> simply stays silent, and the picture is unaffected.

### entity (Required)

*string*

The camera entity to show. Does not need to be one of the cameras set with `home_cameras`.

### seconds (Required)

*integer*

How long to show it for. `0` means the default, 30 seconds.

### sound (Required)

*string*

Whether to play the camera's audio with the view: `on` or `off`. Anything else — an empty string
included — leaves it to the device's own **Camera sound** setting, off on a new device.

The sound is heard over whatever the device is playing, which carries on underneath and comes back
up when the view ends — further down than it goes for an answer, since a camera's own audio is what
its microphone hears and is lost under a room's music otherwise. A **Mute** control on the view silences it without closing it: the stream
keeps arriving and what arrives is thrown away rather than played, so the music comes back up to its
own level and **Unmute** brings the sound back at once. The control reads Unmute whenever there is
nothing to silence — silenced from the screen, taken by an answer or an announcement, or never
arrived. A reply or an announcement takes the speaker from the camera for as long as it lasts, and
the view's sound comes back after it. The sound stops when the view does.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_home_show_camera_sound
data:
  entity: camera.front_door
  seconds: 60
  sound: "on"
```

## Choose the calendars shown

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_calendar_sources`.

Chooses which of Home Assistant's calendars this device shows, for its calendar page and event
pop-ups. Each device keeps its own: one on a desk can show its owner's calendar, one in a kitchen the
family's. Screen devices only. The calendars come from whatever Home Assistant connects to - Google
Calendar, iCloud through CalDAV, an Outlook calendar through Microsoft 365 or a published link, its
own Local Calendar - so no calendar password is ever on a device. Needs `home_assistant` set up first.

### calendars (Required)

*string*

Calendar entities, separated by commas, in the order to show them. Empty shows no calendar.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_calendar_sources
data:
  calendars: calendar.family, calendar.work
```

## Show the calendar

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_calendar_show`.

Opens the calendar page on a Show, on this month, as a tap on the date under the clock does. The page
shows the month with each day's events on it; a tap on a day lists its events, and a tap on an event
opens its details. It closes after two minutes untouched, or with Done. Fails on a device that shows
no calendar (choose one with `calendar_sources`, or Settings, General, Calendars). No arguments.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_calendar_show
```

## Choose the calendars that pop up

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_calendar_popup_sources`.

With **Event pop-ups** on, an event coming up shows over the screen: a timed event a while before it
starts (the **Pop up** select, a quarter hour by default), an all-day event once in the morning, as
the night hours end. At night and in quiet hours it makes no sound and does not light a dark screen.
Each pop-up fires an `esphome.techo5_calendar` event with `event: popup`, `summary`, `calendar`,
`start` and `device`. This action chooses which of the device's calendars pop up. A Show only.

### calendars (Required)

*string*

Calendar entities, separated by commas. Empty is every calendar the device shows.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_calendar_popup_sources
data:
  calendars: calendar.family
```

## Set the night hours

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_screen_night_hours`.

Sets when the night starts and ends on a Show: the hours the screen goes dark, or down to its night
light, by itself. Any times, to the minute, and the night may cross midnight. The same can be set on
the screen (Settings, Display, Night hours, Custom) and with the **Night hours**, **Night starts**
and **Night ends** selects, which offer quarter hours.

### start (Required)

*string*

When the night starts, in 24-hour time: `19:00`.

### end (Required)

*string*

When it ends: `09:30`. Both empty turns the night off.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_screen_night_hours
data:
  start: "19:00"
  end: "09:30"
```

### Turning the night on from an automation

A Show also has a **Night mode** switch, on while it is night. Turn it on or off from an automation,
a "house to sleep" scene for example, to start or end the night now. With night hours set, the switch
holds until the hours next start or end the night, then the hours take over again. To leave the night
to Home Assistant entirely, set **Night hours** to **Controlled by Home Assistant**: the hours are then
ignored and it is night only while the switch is on.

```yaml
action: switch.turn_on
target:
  entity_id: switch.office_night_mode
```

## Point the device at a dashboard server

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_dashboard_server`.

Where the dashcast server is, for a streamed dashboard, and the key it asks for. The same can be set
on the device's setup page, which is easier for a long key. See [Dashboards](dashboards.md).

### address (Required)

The server's address and port, like `192.168.1.20:9555`.

### key (Required)

The key the server was started with (`DASHCAST_KEY`).

## Choose the dashboard shown

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_dashboard_path`.

Which dashboard the screen shows, as its path in Home Assistant's address bar. The device's
**Dashboard to show** list sets the same thing, and is usually easier. See [Dashboards](dashboards.md).

### path (Optional)

`lovelace/0`, `dashboard-kitchen/lights`, `energy`, … Empty is the Rooms dashboard when drawn, and
the default dashboard when streamed.

## Show or hide the dashboard

In YAML, refer to these actions as `esphome.<node>_dashboard_show` and `esphome.<node>_dashboard_hide`.

`dashboard_show` puts the dashboard up, the same as swiping it in (on a Spot, the Dashboard item in
the ring menu). It stays up until `dashboard_hide`, a swipe or "go home" takes it down. It doesn't
time out the way one opened by hand does (after **Dashboard returns to the clock after**, 10 minutes
unless changed). If the settings, a camera or a call has the screen, the dashboard comes up once
they're done. The **Dashboard** setting must not be **Off**.

`dashboard_hide` goes back to the clock. With **Dashboard when idle** on, the clock stays for 2
minutes, then the dashboard comes back, the same as swiping it away.

For example, show a Now Playing dashboard while a speaker plays:

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: media_player.living_room_sonos
    to: playing
    id: playing
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: media_player.living_room_sonos
    from: playing
    for: "00:05:00"
    id: stopped
actions:
  - if:
      - condition: trigger
        id: playing
    then:
      - action: esphome.office_dashboard_show
    else:
      - action: esphome.office_dashboard_hide
```

## Press a deck button

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_deck_press`.

Does what a TECHO5 Deck button does, as if it were pressed on the screen: an automation can switch
an OBS scene or start the stream with it. Show only. See [TECHO5 Deck](deck.md).

### page (Required)

The page, counting from 1.

### button (Required)

The button on that page, counting from 1, row by row: on a 4-across deck the second row starts at 5.

## Play a video

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_play_video`.

Plays a video full screen, with its sound, in place of any video already playing. Show and Spot,
and only while the **Video** switch is on. See [Video](video.md).

### url (Required)

*string*

An `http://` or `https://` address: MP4, MKV, MPEG-TS or HLS, best as H.264 at 720p or less. Other
kinds of address (files, `rtsp://`) are refused.

### title (Required)

*string*

What the screen and the **Video title** sensor call it. `""` for none: they show the address's host
instead.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_play_video
data:
  url: "http://192.168.1.20:8096/Videos/clip.mp4"
  title: "Front door"
```

## Stop, pause or carry on a video

In YAML, refer to these actions as `esphome.<node>_stop_video`, `esphome.<node>_pause_video` and
`esphome.<node>_resume_video`. They take nothing, and do nothing when no video is playing. Stop also
takes down a DLNA video's question on the screen.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_stop_video
data: {}
```

## Choose the weather shown on the idle screen

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_home_weather`.

Sets which weather forecast the device's clock/idle screen shows. Screen devices only. Needs
`home_assistant` set up first, or no forecast will show.

### entity (Optional)

*string*

A `weather.*` entity to show, `default` (or left blank) for Home Assistant's own forecast
(`weather.forecast_home`, the one set up automatically for the home's location), or `none` to show
no weather at all. Matching is case-insensitive.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_home_weather
data:
  entity: weather.forecast_home
```

## Show chips along the foot of the clock

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_home_glance`.

Sets the glance strip: Home Assistant entities shown as chips (a pill with the entity's icon and a
short line) along the foot of the clock page, each only while it has something to say. The Echo Show
only; the Spot and the Dot don't have it. The list persists and the device follows the entities itself, so a chip comes and goes with its
entity's state and nothing has to be sent again. A value that leaves the chips as they were
does not redraw the screen.

What each entity shows:

- **Off, idle, closed, locked, empty, zero (`0`, `0.0`), `unknown` or `unavailable`**: nothing.
- **A switch-like entity** (`binary_sensor`, `input_boolean`, `switch`, `light`, `lock`, `cover`, …)
  that is on or open: its name.
- **A number**: its name, the value and the unit ("Kitchen 21.5°C").
- **Anything else**: the state itself, which is how a template sensor made for the strip reads
  ("Washer done", "6:00 PM: water the plants"). A state name reads as words: `not_home` shows as
  "Not home".

The icon is the entity's own, or one for its domain. Chips that don't fit are left for when there is
room, in the order given. A running timer or the music strip takes the foot of the page instead.

> **Good to know**
>
> A number's chip shows its value, so the screen redraws every time the value changes. A power or
> energy sensor that reports every few seconds redraws the clock page every few seconds. For those,
> make a template sensor that says only what matters ("Washer running", or nothing) and put that in
> the list instead.

### entities (Required)

*string*

The entities, comma separated, in the order to show them: up to 8, and each once (a repeat and any
past the eighth are left out). Empty takes the strip away.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_home_glance
data:
  entities: input_boolean.guest_mode, sensor.washer_status, binary_sensor.front_door
```

## Wire up the radio page

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_home_radio`.

Configures the device's Radio page: which stations it lists, what plays them, and what shows as
"now playing". Screen devices only; the change takes effect the next time the device reconnects.

> **Good to know**
>
> Favorites (`stations`) play through a Home Assistant script over the device's normal API
> connection, not through `home_assistant`. The Radio Browser stations near your home, shown
> alongside your favorites, do use `home_assistant` — without it, that part of the list is empty.

### stations (Optional)

*string*

A comma-separated list of `input_select` entities, each one a station or preset to offer on the
Radio page. Up to 20.

### now (Optional)

*string*

An entity whose state names whatever is currently playing, shown on the Radio page and the idle
screen while it's live.

### service (Optional)

*string*

The script or action that actually plays a station when one is picked on the device.

### field (Optional)

*string*

The name of the argument `service` expects the chosen station in. Defaults to `station` if left
blank.

### speaker_field (Optional)

*string*

The name of the argument `service` expects this device's media player in. Defaults to `speaker` if
left blank.

### speaker (Optional)

*string*

This device's own `media_player.*` entity, passed to `service` in `speaker_field` so the script
knows which speaker to target.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_home_radio
data:
  stations: input_select.office_radio_stations
  now: sensor.office_radio_now_playing
  service: script.play_radio_station
  field: station
  speaker_field: speaker
  speaker: media_player.office
```

## Center the rain map and weather alerts somewhere else

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_home_location`.

The rain map and the weather alerts are centered on Home Assistant's home. A device that lives
somewhere else, with family in another town, can be given a zone of its own instead: create the zone in
Home Assistant (**Settings → Areas, labels & zones → Zones**), then give its entity here. Screen devices
only. Set its weather with [`home_weather`](#choose-the-weather-shown-on-the-idle-screen) as well, for
a forecast for the same place.

### zone (Required)

*string*

A `zone.*` entity, or empty (or `home`) for Home Assistant's home again. A zone Home Assistant doesn't
know leaves the rain map and alerts saying the location isn't known, rather than showing home's.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_home_location
data:
  zone: zone.cabin
```

## Set the slideshow's photo source

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_home_slideshow`.

Sets the Home Assistant media source the idle-screen slideshow shows photos from — the same setting
as the screen's own folder picker. Screen devices only. Whether the photos show behind the ordinary
clock (Background mode) or take over the whole screen after a wait (Screensaver mode), and options
like shuffle, subfolders and time per photo, are set separately as entities
(`select.<node>_slideshow`, `switch.<node>_slideshow_shuffle`, `number.<node>_slideshow_interval`,
and so on), not by this action. Needs `home_assistant` set up first, or no photos will show.

### source (Required)

*string*

A Home Assistant media source ID — the same ID browsing a media source in Home Assistant returns
for a folder (an Immich album, a network share, or anything else `media_source` can browse), e.g.
`media-source://media_source/local/Photos`. An empty value clears the source, so nothing is shown
whatever mode is selected.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_home_slideshow
data:
  source: "media-source://media_source/local/Photos"

## List saved voice recordings

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_recordings`.

Returns the IDs of the voice-turn recordings currently kept on the device, most recent first, so
Home Assistant can offer them for playback. The device keeps 0–10 of them per assistant (set with
the "keep recordings" number entity; off by default). This action answers with data — call it with
a `response_variable` rather than as a plain fire-and-forget action.

Takes no parameters.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_recordings
response_variable: recent
```

## Fetch a saved voice recording

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_turn_audio`.

Fetches one saved recording's audio as base64-encoded WAV, by an ID from `recordings`. A clip larger
than about 32 KiB of base64 comes back split into pages — check the response for how many pages
there are and call again for each one. This action answers with data; call it with a
`response_variable`.

### id (Required)

*string*

One of the recording IDs `recordings` returned.

### page (Optional)

*integer*

Which page of the audio to fetch, starting at 0. Defaults to 0.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_turn_audio
data:
  id: "{{ recent.ids[0] }}"
  page: 0
response_variable: clip
```

## Set the SSH authorized keys

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_ssh_keys`.

Replaces the device's SSH `authorized_keys`, one public key per line. This is the only way keys get
onto the device — nothing is baked into the image, and the on-screen SSH switch can only turn the
server on or off, not add anyone.

> **Good to know**
>
> This needs an API encryption key, not `home_assistant`: it's refused unless Home Assistant's
> *ESPHome* link to the device already has a real encryption key set, since otherwise the keys would
> cross the network in the clear.

### keys (Required)

*string*

Newline-separated public keys, each a full `authorized_keys` line (type, key, optional comment) —
`ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp384`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`,
`sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com`, or `sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com`. A private key, or any line
that isn't recognized as one of these types, is rejected and none of the keys are changed. An empty
value removes every key and turns SSH off if it's running.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_ssh_keys
data:
  keys: |
    ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIExample you@your-pc
```

## Set the settings lock's PIN

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_settings_lock_pin`.

Sets the PIN the device asks for before its settings screen opens (Show and Spot). Everything else on
the device works without it: the clock, music, the voice assistant, calls. The **Settings lock**
switch shows whether a PIN is set; turning it off removes the PIN, which is the way back in if it is
forgotten. The PIN can also be set on the device (Settings → Privacy & Security → Settings lock) and
on the setup page.

> **Good to know**
>
> Like `ssh_keys`, this is refused unless Home Assistant's *ESPHome* link to the device already has a
> real encryption key set, so the PIN never crosses the network in the clear.

### pin (Required)

*string*

4 to 8 digits. Empty removes the PIN and the lock.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_settings_lock_pin
data:
  pin: "2468"
```

## Sign a device in to a SIP account

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_phone_account`.

Signs the device in to a SIP provider so it can place and receive calls. The login is kept on the
device in its own owner-only file — never in the settings Home Assistant or diagnostics can read.

> **Good to know**
>
> This needs an API encryption key, not `home_assistant`: it's refused unless Home Assistant's
> *ESPHome* link to the device already has a real encryption key set, since otherwise the password
> would cross the network in the clear.

### server (Required)

*string*

The provider's SIP server (e.g. a VoIP.ms POP such as `chicago1.voip.ms`).

### username (Required)

*string*

The SIP account's username. An empty value signs the device out and removes the stored login
instead of signing in.

### password (Required)

*string*

The SIP account's password.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_phone_account
data:
  server: chicago1.voip.ms
  username: "100000_office"
  password: !secret techo5_office_sip_password
```

## Place a call

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_phone_call`.

Places a call from the device. Does nothing on its own — this is how an automation or voice command
dials out; the device never calls anyone by itself.

### number (Required)

*string*

A phone number or another SIP account's extension. Spaces, dashes and a leading `+` are dropped
before dialing.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_phone_call
data:
  number: "15551234567"
```

## Call another device in the house

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_intercom_call`.

Calls another TECHO5 device in the house over the intercom: it rings there with this device's name,
and once someone answers, the two talk. No phone account, Home Assistant or internet is involved in
the call itself. Answering and hanging up are the same as for a phone call (below), and the call
fires the same `esphome.techo5_phone` events, with `kind: intercom`.

> **Good to know**
>
> Both devices need the same house word, set on each device's setup page (the one announcing uses).
> A device with no house word takes no calls, and one with a different word refuses them.
>
> The device called decides how it takes the call. With **Intercom do not disturb** on, it turns the
> call away (`reason: do not disturb`). With **Allow Drop In** on, it chimes and connects by itself,
> with no one answering, and its screen says **Drop In**. Both are off by default, and are switches
> in Home Assistant and settings on a screen (Sound & Voice, and Privacy & Security). After a call is
> declined, the same device cannot ring it again for 30 seconds.

### device (Required)

*string*

The name of the device to call, as it shows in Home Assistant ("Kitchen"). Capitals do not matter.
The device has to be on and on the same network; the call fails at once if it is not found.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_intercom_call
data:
  device: Kitchen
```

## Set the screen's contact list

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_phone_contacts`.

Sets the contacts a device with a screen offers to call without a voice command, up to 12. The
numbers are kept on the device in their own owner-only file, not in Home Assistant.

### contacts (Required)

*string*

A comma-, newline-, or semicolon-separated list of `Name=number` pairs:

```text
Alex=15551234567, Sam=15557654321, Kitchen=106
```

An empty value clears the list.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_phone_contacts
data:
  contacts: "Alex=15551234567, Kitchen=106"
```

## Answer a call

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_phone_answer`.

Answers the device's currently ringing call, phone or intercom, the same as pressing its action button, tapping its
screen, or using the **Answer call** button Home Assistant shows while it rings.

Takes no parameters.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_phone_answer
```

## Hang up

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_phone_hangup`.

Ends the device's call, whether it's ringing (incoming or outgoing) or already up — the same as
pressing its action button again, the **Hang up** / **Decline** button, or a swipe or tap on its
screen.

Takes no parameters.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_phone_hangup
```

## Announce to the house

In YAML, refer to this action as `esphome.<node>_announce_house`.

Says something on every other TECHO5 device in the house. What it does depends on whether you
give it words:

- **With `text`**, it speaks those words. Devices with a screen show them; a Dot chimes and stays
  quiet, since it has no way to read them aloud.
- **With no `text`**, it opens the device's microphone, plays a tone, and sends what is said as
  audio. That is the announcement people mean: your own voice in every room, recorded on one
  device and played on the others.

The recording ends when you stop talking, or at fifteen seconds, or when somebody taps the screen
of the device that is listening. One that nobody spoke into is dropped rather than sent as a chime
and silence.

> **Good to know**
>
> Announcements go device to device over the local network, not through Home Assistant, so this
> action is a way to start one rather than a route the audio takes. They keep working with Home
> Assistant switched off; this action is simply not available then.
>
> Every device needs the same **house word** set on its setup page. A device with no word set
> neither sends announcements nor takes them, and this action will say so in the log rather than
> failing.
>
> Quiet hours are respected: inside them an announcement is shown and not sounded. Alarms, timers
> and calls are not announcements and are not affected.

### text (Optional)

*string*

What to say. Leave it out, or pass an empty string, to record instead.

```yaml
action: esphome.office_announce_house
data:
  text: "dinner is ready"
```

```yaml
# No text: opens the microphone and sends what is said.
action: esphome.office_announce_house
data:
  text: ""
```
