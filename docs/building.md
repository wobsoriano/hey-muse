# Building TECHO5 yourself

You don't need any of this to install or update a Show 5. `tools/install-show.py` and Home
Assistant's update card use the signed releases. This page is for changing the daemon or the images.

The Echo Dot and Echo Spot have their own pages:
[techo5-dot docs/building.md](https://github.com/HuskerMinion/techo5-dot/blob/main/docs/building.md) and
[techo5-spot docs/building.md](https://github.com/HuskerMinion/techo5-spot/blob/main/docs/building.md).

## 1. Set up your computer

Everything is Go, Python 3 and bash. Two builds need Linux: the root filesystem (it runs Alpine's
package manager under QEMU) and the kernel.

**Linux** (Ubuntu or Debian; other distributions have the same packages under similar names):

```
sudo apt install git python3 qemu-user-static binfmt-support uidmap \
    build-essential bc bison flex libssl-dev curl xz-utils bzip2
```

and Go 1.26 or later from [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) (distribution packages are often older).

**Windows:** install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (its Git Bash runs the
`.sh` scripts), [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) and [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then
install WSL with Ubuntu (`wsl --install -d Ubuntu`) and, inside Ubuntu, the Linux packages above. The
root filesystem build runs in WSL on its own when you start it from Git Bash; the kernel build is run
inside Ubuntu. On Windows, type `python` where this page says `python3`.

**macOS:** `xcode-select --install` (git, bash, Python 3), then `brew install go`. The daemon and the
boot image build on macOS. The root filesystem is built on a running Show instead (step 4 does that
over SSH), and the kernel needs a Linux machine or virtual machine.

Get the code (the three repositories side by side, if you build for more than one device):

```
git clone https://github.com/wobsoriano/hey-muse
cd techo5
```

## 2. Fetch the inputs

```
python3 tools/fetch-inputs.py --device show
```

That fills `inputs/` (git-ignored) with Alpine's base image, `busybox.static`, `apk.static`, the rescue
environment's packages and the wake word models, each from its public source. The root filesystem
build looks for `apk.static` in your home directory, so on Linux (or inside WSL's Ubuntu) also run:

```
mkdir -p ~/apk && cp inputs/apk.static ~/apk/apk.static
```

(From WSL the repository is under `/mnt/c/...` or wherever you cloned it.)

**From your own Show, for a boot image only:** its LineageOS boot image, as
`inputs/boot-lineage-18.1-20260904-cronos.img`. The installer keeps one in `backups/<serial>/`, or with
LineageOS running and Rooted debugging on: `adb pull /dev/block/mmcblk0p9 inputs/boot-lineage-18.1-20260904-cronos.img`.

This one file is yours and stays yours. Every board needs its own — the header, the load addresses and
the kernel command line in a boot image come from the one it was built against, so a Show 8's image has
to start from a Show 8's. It is Amazon's, it is specific to your unit, and this project neither fetches
it nor publishes it. `fetch-inputs.py` takes only what is public; the donor image is the one input you
supply yourself, on every board.

No vendor tree (LineageOS's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers and firmware) is needed or published: each
Show keeps its own in the slot store.

## 3. The daemon

```
cd echod
go test ./...
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o ../bin/echod-arm ./cmd/echod
cd ..
```

(`go test` runs everywhere; a few hardware packages only build for Linux.) To try a daemon on a Show
already running TECHO5: turn on its SSH switch in Home Assistant with a key sent through the
`ssh_keys` action, copy the binary over, and bind it in place until the next reboot:

```
scp bin/echod-arm root@<address>:/tmp/echod-test
ssh root@<address> 'mount --bind /tmp/echod-test /usr/local/bin/techo5 && killall techo5'
```

## 4. The root filesystem

[tools/linux/deploy-rootfs.sh](../tools/linux/deploy-rootfs.sh) builds the daemon and tools and then the
root filesystem ([mkrootfs.sh](../tools/linux/mkrootfs.sh), with the packages in
[packages-rootfs.txt](../tools/linux/packages-rootfs.txt)):

```
bash tools/linux/deploy-rootfs.sh --out build/rootfs.tar.gz --version v0.0.0-test                  # Linux, or Git Bash on Windows
HOST=<address> bash tools/linux/deploy-rootfs.sh --version v0.0.0-test --install                      # build and install on a running Show
```

The first keeps the tarball. The second sends it to a Show (SSH on, as above) and installs it into the
spare slot, where it boots on trial and falls back if it doesn't settle. On macOS only the second
works: the build then runs on the Show itself, which takes a few minutes longer.

## 5. The kernel (Bluetooth)

LineageOS's kernel has no Bluetooth stack. [tools/linux/build-kernel.sh](../tools/linux/build-kernel.sh)
rebuilds it at the exact commit the LineageOS image came from, so the vendor modules still load, with
Bluetooth added. On Linux, or inside WSL's Ubuntu:

```
bash tools/linux/build-kernel.sh -o inputs/Image.gz-dtb-bt
```

Its header lists the source checkout and the toolchain (Arm's GCC 8.3, downloaded without root).
[tools/linux/README.md](../tools/linux/README.md) has the device tree edit that gives the daemon both
microphones instead of their average (`patch-dtb.py`, which needs `python3 -m pip install fdt`).

**Which configuration.** All three Shows build from the same kernel commit and differ only in
`DEFCONFIG`, and each wants a `KOUT` of its own so one board's objects are not read as another's:

| Board | `DEFCONFIG` | |
|---|---|---|
| Echo Show 5 2nd gen | `cronos_defconfig` | the default |
| Echo Show 5 1st gen | `checkers_defconfig` | plus `PATCHES=tools/linux/patches` |
| Echo Show 8 1st gen | `crown_defconfig` | plus `PATCHES=tools/linux/patches` |

Both 1st gen boards have a mute latch that the 2nd gen doesn't, and `tools/linux/patches` holds three
fixes for it:

- `checkers-0001-mic-enable-on-capture.patch` puts the microphone pin back when a capture stream opens
  and the latch reads ungated.
- `checkers-0002-camera-follows-the-latch.patch` lets the camera follow the latch itself, so a quick
  tap to unmute no longer leaves the camera blocked until a reboot, and starts the driver from the
  latch's real state after a boot with it engaged. A mute that is still being turned on counts as on,
  and a state pin that can't be read counts as muted.
- `checkers-0003-mute-button-follows-a-short-press.patch` keeps the driver's idea of the latch right
  after a quick tap to unmute, so the next long press mutes instead of doing nothing.

Despite the names they are not only for the 1st gen Show 5: they touch `drivers/misc/gating.c`,
`include/misc/gating.h`, `mt_soc_machine.c` and the checkers and crown camera drivers, and the Show 8
has the same latch. `crown_defconfig` is in
the Amazon kernel tree already, beside the others, at the same commit — it was diffed against a Show 8's
own `/proc/config.gz`, 1341 options each side and no differences either way.

## 6. The boot image

```
KERNEL=inputs/Image.gz-dtb-bt bash tools/linux/build-image.sh -o build/techo5-boot.img --no-key
```

`--no-key` is how releases are built: the rescue environment then accepts only SSH keys already on the
unit. Put your public key at `inputs/techo5_ed25519.pub` and leave `--no-key` out to have it built in.

`KERNEL_IMAGE` is the donor: your own unit's LineageOS boot image, which the new image takes its
header, load addresses and command line from (step 2). It defaults to the 2nd gen Show 5's, so on a
1st gen or a Show 8 point it at that unit's own:

```
KERNEL_IMAGE=inputs/boot-lineage-crown.img KERNEL=inputs/Image.gz-dtb-crown-bt \
  bash tools/linux/build-image.sh -o build/techo5-boot-crown.img --no-key
```

**Build the image you are going to publish, and boot that one.** An image built with a key in it and
the same image built `--no-key` are different files, and only the one you booted is known to work —
`release.ps1` refuses an image carrying `root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, so the keyed one is not the one
that ships.

## 7. Install your build

On a Show still running LineageOS, the installer takes your files in place of the release's:

```
python3 tools/install-show.py --serial <serial> --name Kitchen --boot build/techo5-boot.img --rootfs build/rootfs.tar.gz
```

On a Show already running TECHO5, step 4's `--install` puts a root filesystem in the spare slot. A boot
image goes on with `fastboot flash boot` (with the Show in fastboot, docs/install.md step 3).

## Optional: the echo canceller

[tools/linux/build-aec.sh](../tools/linux/build-aec.sh) compiles the WebRTC echo canceller helper for
armv7 (Linux or WSL). `deploy-rootfs.sh` includes `bin/techo5-aec-arm` when it exists.

## Optional: the built-in voice

[tools/linux/build-pico.sh](../tools/linux/build-pico.sh) compiles the built-in voice's helper (SVOX
Pico, tools/pico) for armv7 with `zig cc`, on macOS, Linux or WSL. `deploy-rootfs.sh` includes
`bin/techo5-pico-arm` and the voice's data when it exists. Without it Muse can only answer aloud
through a speech endpoint.

## Optional: a CPU profile from a device

To see where the daemon spends its time on a unit, turn SSH on and write the number of seconds to a
file the daemon watches:

```
echo 60 > /run/techo5/profile
```

A few seconds later the profile starts, and when it ends it is written to
`/data/techo5-linux/cpu-<time>.pprof` (the daemon's log says so). Copy it off and read it with
`go tool pprof -top cpu-<time>.pprof`. Nothing listens on the network for this; it only answers that
file, which only root on the device can create.

## Package versions

`tools/linux/packages.txt` and `packages-rootfs.txt` name exact Alpine package versions. Alpine keeps
only the newest build of each package, so an old version eventually disappears from its mirror:
`fetch-inputs.py` then takes the newest and says so, and a root filesystem build installs whatever
Alpine 3.24 serves that day. Releases don't depend on this: everything a unit or the installer needs
is published with the release, and the lists are brought up to date (and tested) before a release.

What version arrives floats; what arrives unchecked does not. Every package `fetch-inputs.py` keeps has
to match the checksum Alpine's index gives for it and the datahash inside the package itself, and the
wake word models come from a commit pinned in the script, each file pinned to a sha256. Moving a model
pin is a two-line edit at the top of `tools/fetch-inputs.py`; the script prints what a file now hashes
to when it does not match, and techo5-dot's `tools/install-dot.py` carries the same pins for the models
it puts on a Dot.

## Releases (maintainer)

`tools/release.ps1` (Show 5), techo5-dot's `tools/release-dot.ps1` and techo5-spot's
`tools/release-spot.ps1` sign a manifest with the key in `TECHO5_SIGN_KEY` and publish with `gh`. They
are PowerShell scripts for the maintainer's Windows machine. Devices only take a manifest signed by the
project's key, and the installers check the same signature before they believe a manifest, so a fork
publishing its own releases needs its own key, a daemon built with its public key
(`echod/internal/update/trust.go`) and the same key in `tools/techo5lib.py` (`RELEASE_KEY`).

This repository is such a fork. Its own release, from a Mac, is in
[releasing-the-fork.md](releasing-the-fork.md).

`TECHO5_SIGN_KEY` never leaves the maintainer's machine — it is not a GitHub Actions secret, and the
build itself does not need to happen locally to keep that true. Pushing a release tag runs
[.github/workflows/build.yml](../.github/workflows/build.yml), which tests every device's build and
builds `echod-arm`, `echod-arm-dot` and `echod-arm-spot` on GitHub's own runners, attesting (via
Sigstore, keyless) that they came from that exact commit and tag — so anyone, not just the maintainer,
can check a release actually matches this repo's source instead of trusting that it does.

Each device keeps its own version numbers, and Home Assistant compares the version a device's daemon
reports with its release's, so the tag names the device: `vX.Y.Z` for the Show, `dot-vX.Y.Z`,
`spot-vX.Y.Z`. The binaries are stamped `vX.Y.Z`. All tags go on this repository, since the daemon
for all three is built here:

```
git tag v0.6.0 && git push origin v0.6.0                       # the Show; triggers the workflow
gh run download -n techo5-v0.6.0 -D bin                        # once it finishes
.\tools\release.ps1 -Version v0.6.0 -Notes "..." -PrebuiltArm bin\echod-arm -PrebuiltArmDot bin\echod-arm-dot -Agents bin
```

All three Shows share the tag `vX.Y.Z` and the one `echod-arm`: which board a unit is settles itself at
run time from the panel name in its kernel command line. What is per-board is the boot image, and each
goes on the same release under its own name, `-Boot` for the 2nd gen Show 5, `-CheckersBoot` for the
1st gen and `-CrownBoot` for the Show 8. Pass whichever changed; the installer takes the rest from the
newest earlier release that carries them. A boot image is signed into the manifest and checksummed like
everything else, and the script refuses one with an SSH key inside.

Do not give the Show 8 a tag of its own. A `crown-v*` tag would not trigger the workflow, and
`install-show.py` looks back through plain `vX.Y.Z` releases when a release carries no image for a
board, so a separate prefix would make it stop finding them.

For the root filesystem, `PREBUILT_DAEMON=bin/echod-arm tools/linux/deploy-rootfs.sh --out ... --version
v0.6.0` puts that same attested binary in it. The Dot (`git tag dot-v0.5.3`, then techo5-dot's
`release-dot.ps1 -PrebuiltArmDot`) and the Spot (`git tag spot-v0.3.0`, then `BUILD_TAGS=spot
PREBUILT_DAEMON=... deploy-rootfs.sh` and techo5-spot's `release-spot.ps1`) work the same way.

Every one of these runs `gh attestation verify --source-ref refs/tags/<tag>` on the binary itself and
refuses it unless CI built it from that release's own tag. A binary from a branch, or from a run
started by hand (stamped `v0.0.0-dev`), would report the wrong version once installed, and Home
Assistant would offer the update forever. Leaving out the prebuilt binaries still builds locally
exactly as before, for a quick local test release without pushing a tag first.

## Where things default

Everything goes into git-ignored folders in the checkout, and each can be moved with an environment
variable: `inputs/` (`TECHO5_INPUTS`), `build/` (`TECHO5_WORK`), `backups/` (`TECHO5_BACKUPS`).
`KERNEL_IMAGE` and `KERNEL` pick the boot image's kernel; `KEY` or `TECHO5_SSH_KEY` the SSH key
`deploy-rootfs.sh` uses (default `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`); `GO` and `PYTHON` the tools.
