// What an end gives back, and when. A stream ending is what a skip and a pause both look like from here,
// so a release inside a live session is held back far enough that a skip does not flash the clock, and
// it is not made at all for a pause the room asked for - that one keeps the track on the screen with
// play offered. The connection going is the one case that takes the room back whatever was asked for.
//
// The bug this replaces zeroed the claim before the pause branch returned, so the room was held for the
// life of the daemon: the idle screen stuck on the now-playing page, the media player entity reading
// Paused forever, every transport press going to a session that was gone, and only a restart clearing it.

// the room held, showing a track nobody could get rid of, until the connection dropped.

// At once, and not after the grace, because the grace is for a handover: it is there so a skip does not
// flash the clock on the way to the next stream, and nothing follows a stop. Held back, it showed the
// stopped track for two seconds after the press, which is the defect finish() had and was measured with.
