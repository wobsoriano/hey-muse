// Package voice is a turn: hearing a wake word, listening, waiting for an answer and playing it.
//
// Two halves. The conversation is a state machine on its own goroutine, so a button press, a pipeline
// event and a timeout cannot race each other. Around it sits the voice satellite, which is what Home
// Assistant talks to.
//
// Nothing here has an entity: a turn is not a setting and not a reading.
