// The page that answers a browser asking to be let into the setup page.
//
// A press on the device is what proves somebody is standing at it, and the Dot has a button for
// that. The Show has volume and mute and nothing else — so the screen said "press the action
// button", which is a button it does not have, and a browser could ask forever with nothing on the
// device able to say yes. This is that press: over whatever was on the screen, with the refusal
// where the eye lands first and the two answers far enough apart that neither is given by accident.
//
// The two answers are drawn by the same code as every other button on these devices, buttonFace in
// sheet_widgets.go, so they are rounded and lit the way the Spot's are. They used to be square
// beveled boxes and looked like they had come from a different program.
