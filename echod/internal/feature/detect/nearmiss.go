// Ducking after a near miss, so the second try is heard.
//
// Measured on an Echo Dot 2 (techo5-dot docs/microphones.md): over playback the wake word stops
// firing once the echo at the microphones passes about -60 dBFS, and no filter recovers it — what the
// canceller leaves behind is the speaker's own distortion, which the reference it subtracts cannot
// contain. Ducking as the score rises was the obvious answer and does not work: the score passes
// NearMiss only 120-140 ms before it would fire, by which time the word is over.
//
// The near miss itself is the usable signal. Somebody said it, the device almost heard it, and they
// are about to say it again — so the music gets out of the way for a few seconds. It costs nothing
// when nothing is playing, and a false near miss costs a few seconds of quieter music.
