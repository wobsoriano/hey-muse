// from its own proxy, and when that proxy stops — five minutes in, or thirteen, with no pattern to
// it — the device plays the stream out and reports it finished, correctly and uselessly. What the
// room hears is the music stopping for no reason, and somebody has to go and start it again.
//
// So a stream that ends by itself while a station is playing is put back on. A stream that was
// stopped, paused or replaced is not: those are somebody's doing, and undoing them would be a device
// arguing with the person in front of it.
