// Package endpoint decides when the person talking to the device has finished, from how loud the audio
// being sent is.
//
// The pipeline in Home Assistant already decides this with a voice activity detector, and in a quiet
// room it decides well. With a television or someone else talking in the room it does not: a detector
// hears speech, and the room is full of it, so the turn never ends, runs to the device's listening
// limit, and is thrown away - recordings of real turns show the request in the first second or two and
// fourteen seconds of television after it. What tells the two apart is distance. The person asking is
// near the device and the room is not, so after the leveler has had its say the speaker stands several
// times louder than the room around them: in those recordings about 1500 against 300 to 700.
//
// So the turn is over once the audio has fallen back well below the speaker's own level and stayed
// there: relative to them, not to the room, which is the one level here that cannot be known in advance.
