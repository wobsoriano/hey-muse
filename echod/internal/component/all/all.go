// Package all is what this device is made of.
//
// Components register themselves from init, so a component nobody imports is a component that
// silently does not exist — no entity, no lifecycle, no error. This is the one list that pulls them
// in, and importing it is what makes the registry complete.
//
// Order is not decided here. Each component declares its phase and its place within it, so this list
// can stay alphabetical and mean nothing but membership.
