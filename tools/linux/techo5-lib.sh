#
# The supplicant picks a radio at connect time and often takes 2.4 GHz, where the Bluetooth half of the
# same chip shares its antenna and spectrum: on the bench that was 1-4 MB/s against 3-12 MB/s on 5 GHz
# with earbuds connected (2026-09-16). It can also take a far 5 GHz radio: the bench once booted onto one
# at -70 dBm, took 70 s to get a lease and ran at 20-40 Mbit/s, next to a -34 dBm 2.4 GHz radio.
#
# Called by the keeper every minute. A 5 GHz radio at T5_5G_MIN dBm or better is strong: the link moves
# to the strongest one when it is on 2.4 GHz or on a weak 5 GHz radio. With no strong 5 GHz radio, a
# weak 5 GHz link moves to 2.4 GHz when that is T5_2G_GAIN dB stronger and at T5_2G_MIN or better. Until
# the link is on a strong 5 GHz radio it keeps scanning, every five minutes, so a 5 GHz radio that comes
# back (or was never listed: a connected supplicant stops scanning) is found. A move pins the running
# supplicant to the chosen channel, nothing is saved; if it does not associate there within 30 s it
