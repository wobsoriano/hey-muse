# build-kernel.sh — build the Echo Show 5 kernel (LineageOS 18.1 tree, 4.9.337
# arm64) with Bluetooth added, at the exact commit the LineageOS boot image
# was built from so its vendor modules (mt76x8_wlan.ko, mt76x8_bt.ko; built
# with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS) still load. Run inside WSL/Linux.
#
#   tools/linux/build-kernel.sh [-o Image.gz-dtb]
#
# Environment: KSRC (~/kernel: github.com/amazon-oss/android_kernel_amazon_mt8163,
# branch cronos/lineage-18.1), KCOMMIT (8d928c5176cc — `uname -r` on the device
# is 4.9.337-g<KCOMMIT>; the tree must be checked out there and clean, or
# LOCALVERSION_AUTO changes the release string and the modules refuse to load),
# CROSS_COMPILE (an aarch64 GCC; Arm's 8.3-2019.03 release builds it cleanly:
# developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-a/8.3-2019.03/binrel/
# gcc-arm-8.3-2019.03-x86_64-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.xz, no root needed),
# KOUT (build directory; keep it outside the source tree), DEFCONFIG (cronos_defconfig, the 2nd gen
# Show 5; checkers_defconfig for the 1st gen and crown_defconfig for the Echo Show 8, both of which
# run the same commit with their own device trees; give each a KOUT of its own), PATCHES (a directory
# of *.patch applied for this build and taken out again afterwards whatever happens; the release
# string is then pinned as KPATCHED does, since the vendor modules check it).
#
# The 1st gen Show 5 and the Show 8 want PATCHES=tools/linux/patches: the microphone pin back when a
# capture stream opens, the camera following the mute latch, and the button following a short press
# (docs/building.md). Their names say checkers; the Show 8 has the same mute latch.
#
# Afterwards: delete amzn,mic-downmix from the appended device trees the way
# patch-dtb.py does, then build-image.sh KERNEL=<Image.gz-dtb> (see README.md).
