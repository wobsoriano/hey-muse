"""Install TECHO5 on an Echo Show running LineageOS 18.1, or straight from TWRP, in one command.

Three boards install the same way and run the same daemon, which tells them apart at run time from the
panel the bootloader names in the kernel command line: the Echo Show 5 2nd gen (cronos), the Show 5
1st gen (checkers) and the Show 8 1st gen (crown). All three run the same kernel commit, and the
partitions this script writes are numbered the same on each. Each board takes its own boot image from
the release, since the kernel configuration and the device trees differ.

    python3 tools/install-show.py
    python3 tools/install-show.py --serial <serial> --name Kitchen --dry-run
    python3 tools/install-show.py --serial <serial> --name Kitchen --force
    python3 tools/install-show.py --lineage-zip lineage-18.1-...-cronos.zip --wifi MyNetwork

From TWRP (--lineage-zip), a unit fresh from its unlock never has to start LineageOS: the installer
formats userdata, installs the LineageOS zip from TWRP only for the drivers on its system partition, and
goes on from there. Wi-Fi is then given with --wifi, or chosen on the Show's own screen afterward.

Run with nothing, it finds the unit (asking which, when there are several), asks for a name, and asks
once before anything is erased. Every question has a switch, for running it from a script.

Windows, Linux and macOS alike; needs Python 3, adb and fastboot. Nothing is built: the release's boot
image (LineageOS's kernel rebuilt with Bluetooth, and TECHO5's rescue environment, with no SSH key) and
root filesystem are downloaded and checked. Each step is checked before the next:

  1. checks    adb sees the unit as one of the three boards, on the LineageOS kernel TECHO5's is built from
  2. backup    with Rooted debugging on, LineageOS's boot image into backups/<serial>/ (the way back)
  3. release   the boot image and root filesystem, checked against the release's signed manifest
  4. push      the root filesystem onto the unit's storage, checked by md5
  5. flash     the boot image, from the bootloader's fastboot
  6. store     over the USB serial console: this unit's own vendor tree (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers,
               firmware) is kept, LineageOS's system partition becomes the slot store (THIS ERASES
               LINEAGEOS), the root filesystem goes into slot a, and the name, the Home Assistant key and
               an SSH key (--ssh-key) are written
  7. watch     the first boot from slot a to a running daemon

From TWRP the steps before the flash differ: the unit's small partitions are saved into
backups/<serial>/partitions/ first, and after the one question userdata is formatted, LineageOS's zip is
installed and its Wi-Fi driver checked against the kernel TECHO5's is built from. On a Show 5 2nd gen or
a Show 8 the TECHO5 logo then replaces Amazon's at boot (--amazon-logo keeps Amazon's); see put_logo.

The Home Assistant key is kept in backups/<serial>/home-assistant.key (api.psk on a unit installed
before that name) and reused on a later run, so Home Assistant keeps the device. Undo: TWRP stays in
recovery; flash the LineageOS zip and the LineageOS boot image.
