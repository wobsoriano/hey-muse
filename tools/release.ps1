<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Build a versioned daemon, write the update manifest, and publish a GitHub release.

.DESCRIPTION
  The daemon's built-in updater fetches
  https://github.com/wobsoriano/techo5/releases/latest/download/manifest.json (stable) and
  installs the binary it names. This script produces both files and publishes them with gh.

.EXAMPLE
  .\tools\release.ps1 -Version v0.1.0 -Notes "First release: voice satellite on the Echo Show 5."
  .\tools\release.ps1 -Version v0.1.1 -Notes "..." -Prerelease
  .\tools\release.ps1 -Version v0.1.2 -Notes "..." -PrebuiltArm bin\echod-arm -PrebuiltArmDot bin\echod-arm-dot
